# Website-Template

A template for starting web projects, using the [create-ehproject](https://github.com/tdesposito/EH-CreateProject).

You can just clone this, but the intent it to install the create-ehproject tool
and use IT to create and configure your new project.

This is **VERY MUCH** a work in progress. See [the Road Map](ROADMAP.md). Proceed with caution.
