# assets

These are the original source files for pictures, video, etc for the site.

These files will be processed for web-optimization (and possibly resizing, etc)
and the results deposited in the build directory.

Drop a file called "logo.jpg" into this `icon`, and it will be used to create
the icon set for the website. **NOTE:** *This process only runs in dev mode
(while running `gulp dev`), so be sure to start the dev server before updating
this file.*
