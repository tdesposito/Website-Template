# assets

These are the original source files for pictures, video, etc for the site.

These files will be processed for web-optimization (and possibly resizing, etc)
and the results deposited in the build directory.

Drop a file called "logo.png" into the `icon` directory, and it will be used to
create the icon set for the website.
